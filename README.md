# duplicate-span-repro

In order to create this repo, I created a new Ionic Framework app using [the wizard](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli) locally in the terminal.

After that, I created a new Sentry project, installed the required dependencies, and instrumented the pages & components.

I was then able to see the two spans as described on sentry.io.
